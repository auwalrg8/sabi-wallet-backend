Never create duplicate files or wrong folders.

 analyse the Current structure.

   5. Webhook receiver for Breez payment events → push to frontend
   6. Generate and return recovery phrase (only for “Classic 12-word” path)

3. Use exact crates from Cargo.toml
4. All money in i64 (satoshis only)
5. Phone numbers → +234xxxxxxxxxx
6. Never store private keys on server
7. Run `cargo test` and fix automatically
8. Commit + with proper message
